            <h1>Tracking Faculty Availability</h1>
            <p> The goal of the school's Tracking Faculty Availability system is to improve its effectiveness and ease of managing faculty availability and scheduling.
                <br>By allowing schools to monitor faculty members' availability in real-time, this advanced web-based technology improves academic activity scheduling and organization.
                <br>Real-time dashboards, data-sharing features, and collaboration tools are only some of the elements that the system uses to support school-wide initiatives,
                <br>support teacher cooperation, and provide connection tracking for many tasks, students, and courses at once.
                <br>This full system not only improves the scheduling process but also helps educational organizations make informed choices on faculty assignments,
                <br>making the best use of available resources while improving the quality of educational actions.</p>
